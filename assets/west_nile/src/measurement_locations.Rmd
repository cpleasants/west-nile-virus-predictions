## A Plot of Where Mosquitos Were Measured

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggmap) # If you haven't yet, do this: install.packages("ggmap")  

data_dir <- "../input"
wnv <- read.csv(file.path(data_dir, "train.csv"))

# Ggmap is used to download and plot map images. Scripts don't have access to the network, so 
# the map data is included as an input file. 
# I downloaded it with the command: mapdata <- get_openstreetmap(bbox = c(-88.0, 41.6, -87.5, 42.1), color="bw", scale = round(606250/4))
mapdata <- readRDS(file.path(data_dir, "mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.rds"))

```

Here's where we have measurement points for some date in the training data:

```{r}
# Shows where there are measurement points
ggmap(mapdata) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude), data=wnv) +
  ggtitle("Mosquito Measurement Locations")
```
